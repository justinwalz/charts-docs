The [<%= variable :catalog_name, :platform %> MariaDB Galera](https://github.com/bitnami/containers/tree/main/bitnami/mariadb-galera) image allows you to use your custom scripts to initialize a fresh instance. In order to execute the scripts, they must be located inside the chart folder *files/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d* so they can be consumed as a ConfigMap.

Alternatively, you can specify custom scripts using the initdbScripts parameter as dict.

In addition to these options, you can also set an external ConfigMap with all the initialization scripts. This is done by setting the initdbScriptsConfigMap parameter. Note that this will override the two previous options.

The allowed extensions are *.sh*, *.sql* and *.sql.gz*.
