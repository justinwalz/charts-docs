The [<%= variable :catalog_name, :platform %> MariaDB](https://github.com/bitnami/containers/tree/main/bitnami/mariadb) image supports the use of custom scripts to initialize a fresh instance.

Custom scripts may be specified using the *initdbScripts* parameter. Alternatively, an external ConfigMap may be created with all the initialization scripts and the ConfigMap passed to the chart via the *initdbScriptsConfigMap* parameter. Note that this will override the *initdbScripts* parameter.

The allowed extensions are:

* *.sh*
* *.sql*
* *.sql.gz*

These scripts are treated differently depending on their extension. While *.sh* scripts are executed on all the nodes, *.sql* and *.sql.gz* scripts are only executed on the primary nodes. This is because *.sh* scripts support conditional tests to identify the type of node they are running on, while such tests are not supported in *.sql* or *sql.gz* files.

When using a *.sh* script, you may wish to perform a "one-time" action like creating a database. This can be achieved by adding a condition in the *.sh* script to ensure that it is executed only on one node, as shown in the example below:

~~~
initdbScripts:
  my_init_script.sh: |
    #!/bin/sh
    if [[ $(hostname) == *primary* ]]; then
        echo "Primary node"
        mysql -P 3306 -uroot -prandompassword -e "create database new_database";
    else
        echo "No primary node"
    fi
~~~
