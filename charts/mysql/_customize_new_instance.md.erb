The [<%= variable :catalog_name, :platform %> MySQL](https://github.com/bitnami/containers/tree/main/bitnami/mysql) image supports the use of custom scripts to initialize a fresh instance.

In order to execute the scripts, they must be located inside the chart folder *files/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d* so that they may be consumed as a Kubernetes ConfigMap. The allowed extensions are:

* *.sh*
* *.sql*
* *.sql.gz*

These scripts are treated differently depending on their extension. While *.sh* scripts are executed on all the nodes, *.sql* and *.sql.gz* scripts are only executed on the primary nodes. This is because *.sh* scripts support conditional tests to identify the type of node they are running on, while such tests are not supported in *.sql* or *sql.gz* files.

When using a *.sh* script, you may wish to perform a "one-time" action like creating a database. This can be achieved by adding a condition in the *.sh* script to ensure that it is executed only on one node, as shown in the example below:

~~~
initdbScripts:
  my_init_script.sh: |
    #!/bin/sh
    if [[ $(hostname) == *master* ]]; then
      echo "Master node"
      mysql -P 3306 -uroot -prandompassword -e "create database new_database";
    else
      echo "No master node"
    fi
~~~
