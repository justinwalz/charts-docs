To submit an application to the Apache Spark cluster, use the *spark-submit* script, which is available at [https://github.com/apache/spark/tree/master/bin](https://github.com/apache/spark/tree/master/bin).

The command below illustrates the process of deploying one of the sample applications included with Apache Spark. Replace the MASTER-IP-ADDRESS and MASTER-PORT placeholders with the correct master IP address and port for your deployment.

    $ ./bin/spark-submit --class org.apache.spark.examples.SparkPi --master spark://MASTER-IP-ADDRESS:MASTER-PORT  --deploy-mode cluster  ./examples/jars/spark-examples_2.11-2.4.3.jar 1000

> NOTE: It is currently not possible to submit an application to a standalone cluster if RPC authentication is configured. [Learn more about this issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-25078).
