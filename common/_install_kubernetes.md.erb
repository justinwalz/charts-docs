> NOTE: To install a Helm chart repository, it is necessary to have [Helm previously installed and configured in your cluster](/<%=platform_path %>/faq/get-started/install-configure-helm).

    A Helm chart describes a specific version of a solution, also known as a "release". The "release" includes files with Kubernetes-needed resources and files that describe the installation, configuration, usage and license of a chart.

To start using any <%= variable :catalog_name, :platform %> Helm chart, follow these steps:

* Check that your Kubernetes cluster is running by executing the following command:

        $ kubectl cluster-info

* Deploy the chart with the following command:

<% if File.exist?("#{__dir__}/../charts/#{current.app}/install.md.erb") %>
    > NOTE: Remember that MY-RELEASE is a placeholder. Replace it with the name you want to give to the deployment or add the *--generate-name* parameter to automatically generate a name. The name must start and end with a lower-case alphanumeric character and can only contain alphanumeric character, '-' or '.'.

<%= partial "platforms/kubernetes/charts/#{current.app}/install.md.erb" %>

<% else %>
    > NOTE: Remember that MY-RELEASE and CHART are placeholders. Replace MY-RELEASE with the name you want to give to the deployment or add the *--generate-name* parameter to automatically generate a name, and replace CHART with the chart name. The name must start and end with a lower-case alphanumeric character and can only contain alphanumeric character, '-' or '.'.

        $ helm install MY-RELEASE oci://registry-1.docker.io/bitnamicharts/CHART
<% end %>
