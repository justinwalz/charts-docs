Sometimes, due to unexpected issues, installations can become corrupted and get stuck in a *CrashLoopBackOff* restart loop. In these situations, it may be necessary to access the containers and perform manual operations to troubleshoot and fix the issues. To ease this task, the chart has a "Diagnostic mode" that will deploy all the containers with all probes and lifecycle hooks disabled. In addition to this, it will override all commands and arguments with *sleep infinity*.

To activate the "Diagnostic mode", upgrade the release with the following comman. Replace the MY-RELEASE placeholder with the release name:

    $ helm upgrade MY-RELEASE --set diagnosticMode.enabled=true

It is also possible to change the default *sleep infinity* command by setting the *diagnosticMode.command* and *diagnosticMode.args* values.

Once the chart has been deployed in "Diagnostic mode", access the containers by executing the following command and replacing the MY-CONTAINER placeholder with the container name:

     $ kubectl exec -ti MY-CONTAINER -- bash
